# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component solution

(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### Overview
It is not responsive at all, I would not say I tried, but I am trying to wrap my head around it all... So, yes, everything is fixed, basically worse than the last one.
No worries, I will learn on the way anyway!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I am still getting used to it. I am sure it was more comfortable than the last time, but extremly tiring.
I suppose I could count "getting used to it" in...

### Continued development

Get used to it. Get comfortable with it, that is, not have anxiety every time you don't know how to implement something...
I do not know where to start learning, so I will just dive in; keep doing these projects...

### Useful resources

- [developer.mozilla.org] - Helped me with the backround image and difference between the image as an element.
- [w3schools.com] - Looked it up a lot in the process.
