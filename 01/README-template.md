I have learned new concepts to learn later)
I am getting used to all of this, that counts I think.

### Continued development

I have yet to learn responsive design. At the beginning it did not make sense at all, though it still does not, I am getting used to it. I will try to learn next responsive design, that is displays, postitions, queries etc.
