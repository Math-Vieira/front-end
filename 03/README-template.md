## Overview
This was very interesting and cool!
I thought of making collapsing blocks using displaying and hiding, which worked kind of, using js, but I discovered js-less way of doing it. I did not understand it, so I went with the first edition.  

### Links
- [https://developer.mozilla.org] - Used for a lot of css
- [https://www.w3schools.com/] - Sit there 50% of the time; for js and css

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I have discovered even more things...
It all makes sense, yet hard to wrap your head around it.

### Continued development
Keep up the good work!
