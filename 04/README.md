[Social proof section challenge on Frontend Mentor]
(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview
This challenge I tried to first design for mobile, which was easier for some reasons. Then for desktop, just wrote some adjustments. It was very interesting as I discovered even more.
:/ I wonder how much is there...

## My process
1. Set up(fonts, links, stylesheet, and html block-ing)
2. Designed for mobile
3. Designed for desktop

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I have learned that there is something called flexbox, and it is used for responsive design. Also that I finally can choose whether boxes will be vertical or horizontal! I guess it is the main thing, along with the main queries, for building responsive design.

### Continued development
I will try to go deeper with the flexbox model.
